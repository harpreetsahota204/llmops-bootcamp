This code sets up a chatbot that uses the Llama Index for efficient querying of documents (in this case, "hitchhikers.pdf") and utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses. 

Whenever a user sends a message, it queries the indexed document and the model to produce a relevant response, which is then sent back to the user.

# Loading the Index

The code first tries to load an existing index from storage.

If there's an exception, it reads a document named "hitchhikers.pdf", indexes it using the `GPTVectorStoreIndex``, and persists the index in storage.

# `@cl.on_chat_start`` Decorator

• This function is triggered whenever a new chat session starts.

• An instance of the LLMPredictor is created with specific settings for the OpenAI model.

• A ServiceContext object is set up with the predictor, specifying the chunk size for processing and a callback manager.

• The index is converted into a query engine with the specified service context.

• This query engine is then stored in the user's session. It will be used to handle and respond to incoming messages.

# `@cl.on_message` Decorator

• This function is triggered whenever a message is received in the chat.

• It retrieves the previously stored query_engine from the user's session.

• A query is made to this engine using the incoming message as input. The engine then processes the query and returns a response.

• The response is streamed back token by token. If there's a textual response, it's set as the content of the response message.

• Finally, the response message is sent back to the user.
